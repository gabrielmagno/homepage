I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG)](http://www.ufmg.br/). I am currently working at [CAMPS](http://www.camps.dcc.ufmg.br/) under supervision of Prof. [Virgilio Almeida](http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/~virgilio). I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. Currently, my research interests lie in the field of social computing. I study user behavior, social interactions and language patterns in social media and online social networks.
